//null and undefined are both represent the absence of a value

// Null: Must be explicitly assigned and returns object "object" this is known as js bug
// undefined: represents a variable that has been declared but not asssigned a value and returns "undefined"

let x; console.log(x); // undefined	// typeof returns undefined 
let y = null; console.log(y); // null // typeof returns object

//Hoisting is a JavaScript mechanism where variable and function declarations are moved to the top of their scope before code execution
// This means that we can use variable and functions before they are declared.

console.log(x); // Output: undefined 
var x = 10; 
console.log(x); // Output: 10

console.log(y); // Output: ReferenceError: Cannot access 'y' before initialization
let y = 20;
console.log(y); // Output: 20

console.log(z); // Output: ReferenceError: Cannot access 'z' before initialization
const z = 30;
console.log(z); // Output: 30

// Similar to let, const is also hoisted with a temporal dead zone

greet(); // Output: Hello!

function greet() {
  console.log("Hello!");
}

sayHello(); // Output: TypeError: sayHello is not a function

var sayHello = function() {
  console.log("Hello from expression!");
};

// Function expressions are not hoisted(tdz). Calling sayHello before its assignment results in a TypeError


// Hoisting Behavior:
// Inner functions are hoisted within their parent function's scope.
// They are not hoisted to the global scope

function outer() {
    console.log(inner()); // Output: "Inner function called"
  
    function inner() {
      return "Inner function called";
    }
  }
  
  outer();

//  TDZ for let and const: Variables declared with let and const are hoisted, but they exist in a "dead zone" before their actual declaration. 
//   Attempting to access them within this zone throws a ReferenceError. This is to prevent accidental usage of variables before they are properly initialized

// Function Expressions: Since they are not hoisted, they are simply not accessible before their declaration. 
// There's no "dead zone" because they don't exist in memory until they are assigned

// Function expressions are not hoisted. Â  
// They are not subject to the Temporal Dead Zone.
// They are accessible only after their declaration and assignment

// the period in the execution of a JavaScript program where a variable exists but cannot be accessed (TD)
// This occurs during the time between the creation of a variable and the point where it is declared.

// var: function scoped or globally scoped. can be redeclared and updated and hoisted and initialized with undefined 
//let : block scoped. Hoisted but not initialzed(TDZ). cannot be redeclared but can be updated.
// const : block scoped. Hoisted but not initialzed(TDZ). cannot be redecalared or updated.

if (true) {
    var x = 10;

// Variable scope in JavaScript refers to the context in which a variable is defined and determines where it can be accessed or modified in your code
// In js there ar two types of scopes ..
// Global Scope: variable declared outside any function or block and can be accessed from anywhere, include inside functions.
// local Scope: variable declared inside a function or block. Only accessible within that function or block 
// (stored in separate memory space which are reserved for this use Block)
// JavaScript uses lexical Scoping, which means the inner function can access the variable of outer function.

function functionScopeExample() {
    var functionScopedVar = "I am function scoped";
    console.log(functionScopedVar); // Accessible inside the function
  }
  
  functionScopeExample();
  // console.log(functionScopedVar); // ReferenceError: functionScopedVar is not defined

// Variables declared with var inside a function are function-scoped.
// They are accessible only within the function in which they are defined and are not visible outside of it.
// Function scope does not apply to let and const, as they are block-scoped

// Why is Scope Important?
// Avoids Polluting the Global Namespace: Helps prevent variable name conflicts.
// Improves Code Readability: Keeps variables relevant to the area of the program where they are needed.
// Reduces Bugs: Avoids unintended variable overwrites.

// Feature	Global Variable vs	Local Variable
// Declaration   	Outside any function or block	     Inside a function or block
// Scope	   Accessible throughout the program	  Accessible only within its function/block
// Lifetime   	Exists as long as the program runs	   Exists only during function/block execution
// Accessibility    	Accessible from any function or block  	Not accessible outside its scope
// Usage Concerns   	Prone to conflicts and hard to debug	  Safer and easier to debug


//shadowing occurs when a variable declared within a certain scope has the same name as a varibale declared in an outer scope. 
// The Inner variable shadows the outer variable,meanining the outer variable is not accessible within the inner scope.

//Illegal Shadowing haapens when this behavior violets the rules of scope resolution in JavaScript,
// espeically in let, const and var declarations

let x = 10;
{
    var x = 20; // Illegal shadowing in the same scope
    console.log(x);  
}
// SyntaxError: Identifier 'x' has already been declared


let x = 10;

{
    let x = 20; // Legal shadowing
    console.log(x); // Prints 20
}

console.log(x); // Prints 10

let y = 30;

function testShadow() {
    var y = 40; // Legal shadowing, different scopes
    console.log(y); // Prints 40
}

testShadow();
console.log(y); // Prints 30

// Closure in JavaScript
// The combination of function bundled together (encloses) with references to its sorrounding state (the lexical environment);
// In other words, a closure gives us access to its outerscope, and closure is created everytime a function is created, at function careation time
function x(){
  let a=7;
  function y(){
    console.log(a)
  }
  return y;
}
let z= x();
console.log(z);
z();

//used in event handles, callbacks, timeouts, promises, and async functions

function attachClickHandler(buttonId, message) {
  document.getElementById(buttonId).addEventListener('click', function () {
    console.log(message); // Closure keeps `message` accessible
  });
}

// Attaching click handlers with unique messages
attachClickHandler('btn1', 'Button 1 clicked!');
attachClickHandler('btn2', 'Button 2 clicked!');


//functions are block of code designed to perform a specific task. iT is reusable piece of code that can be called multiple times with different inputs (arguments)
//to produce different ouputs

//Function Statement (also called a function declaration) defines a named function, can be hoisted and can be called before declaration
function greet(){
  console.log("JHell");
}
greet();

//Function expression: Assigned to variable, not hoisted; cannot be called before declaration
//function expresion  are not hoisted so, they can be only used after assignment 
// functin expression can be named and anonymous
const g = function(){
  console.log("Hello");
}
g();

//anonymous can be used in contexts like callbacks, IIFE, and event handlers;

//named function expression is function expression with a name;
// named function expression is useful for self-referencing, recursion, and debugging;

// paramter vs arguments
// variable listed in the function definition are called parameters
//actual values that are passed to the function are called arguments when it is called

// First class Functions
// function can be assigned to a variable, passed as an argument to another functionScopeExample, returned from another function

//use cases Event Handlers, Callbacks, Promises, and Async Functions also in middlware in express.js

// Pure Functions are functions that always produce the same output for the same input, and they do not have any side effects
//Does not rely on external state, Make code more predictable and easier to test
function add(a, b) {
  return a+b; //deterministic and no side effects
}

// Impure Functions: Functions that produce different outputs for the same input or have side effects are considered impure

let total =0;
function add(a){
  total +=a; // modifies external variable 'total'
  return total; // returns value depends on external state
}

//An IIFE is a JavaScript Function that runs as soon as it is defined. 
// It is also known as a self-executing anonymous function
//They are typically used to create a local scope for variables to prevent them from polluting the global scope

// for...in loop
// Purpose: Iterates over the enumerable properties (keys) of an object.
// Works on: Objects and arrays (but typically used for objects).
// Behavior:
// It loops through the keys (property names) of an object.
// For arrays, it iterates over the indices (as strings).

const obj = { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 };
for (const key in obj) {

}

const arr = [10, 20, 30];
for (const index in arr) {
  console.log(index, arr[index]); // Outputs: 0 10, 1 20, 2 30
}


// for...of loop
// Purpose: Iterates over the values of an iterable object.
// Works on: Iterables like arrays, strings, Maps, Sets, and more.
// Behavior:
// It loops through the values directly, not the keys or indices.

const arr = [10, 20, 30];
for (const value of arr) {

//how to add remove or delete elements from an array in jaavscript

const vegetables = ["carrot", "beetroot", "potato", "cabbage"];

vegetables.push("spinach"); // Add elements to the end of an array 
vegetables.unshift("Apple"); // Add elements to the beginning of an array

vegetables.pop("cabbage"); // Remove the last element of an array
vegetables.shift("carrot"); // Remove the first element of an array

vegetables.splice(1, 0, 'kiwi'); //Add elements at a specific index
vegetables.splice(2, 1); // Remove elements at a specific index

// array.splice(start, deleteCount, item1, item2, ...);
// The splice() method modifies the original array.
// It can be used for removal, addition, or replacement of elements.
// Negative start values count from the end of the array.
// The returned array contains the elements that were removed (if any).

//Map:- it is a HOF that iterates over each element of an array, allowing us to apply a specified function to each element.
// Does not modify the original array but returns a transformed array based on the logic provided
// map returns a new array of same length as original
// It is commonly used to transform or process data

const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];
const doubled = numbers.map(num => num * 2);
console.log(doubled); // Output: [2, 4, 6, 8]

//Filter: Filter elements based on a condition and returns a new array with the elements that pass the condition
// the length of the returned array may be different from the original array


const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

// Example: Filtering even numbers
const evenNumbers = numbers.filter(num => num % 2 === 0);
console.log(evenNumbers); // Output: [2, 4]

// Reduce: reduces an array to a single value 
// it iterates over each element of an array and accumulates the results based on the logic provided in the callback
// the accumulator stores the final result of the reduce operation

const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

// Find the average using `reduce`
const average = numbers.reduce((sum, num, index, array) => sum + num / array.length, 0);
console.log(average); // Output: 3
